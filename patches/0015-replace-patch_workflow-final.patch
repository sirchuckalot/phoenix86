+# Patch Workflow
+Recap of the final workflow
+
+From here on out you’ve got a fully automated, error‑resilient patch workflow.
+
+## 1. Fetch + clean state (only needed if you ever get out of sync)
+
+```bash
+git fetch origin main
+git switch main
+git reset --hard origin/main
+git clean -fdx
+```
+
+## 2. Stage your changes
+
+```bash
+git add <files>
+```
+
+## 3. Generate a patch
+
+```bash
+scripts/make-patch.sh "Describe what you changed"
+```
+↪ writes patches/000N-Describe-what-you-changed.patch
+
+## 4. Apply & push
+
+```bash
+scripts/apply-patches.sh
+```
+↪ resets to origin/main, git am-s each patch, then git push
+
