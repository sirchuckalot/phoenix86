# Phoenix86

**Phoenix86** is a clean-room, open-source 8086-compatible CPU core written in Verilog.  
Built from scratch using a microcoded architecture and designed to be fully PC-compatible  
at the hardware level, including VGA text display, keyboard input, and BIOS-level execution.

## Features

- 🔧 Microcoded control unit with full 8086 instruction set support  
- 🧠 Human-readable microcode (also encoded in ROM)  
- 🧪 Testbenches for instruction-level validation  
- 🖥️ PC-compatible system simulation: VGA, keyboard, BIOS, DOS loading  
- 🏗️ Clean-room design: no proprietary or copied code, all specs derived from documentation  
- 🔓 Licensed under the Apache 2.0 license for maximum openness and permissive use

## Project Vision

> **Rebuilding the x86 legacy from the ground up.**  
> Clean-room. Microcoded. Synthesizable.
